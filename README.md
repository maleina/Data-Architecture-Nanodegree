# Data-Architecture-Nanodegree

I completed the [Data Architect Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-architect-nanodegree--nd038) program at Udacity.com, which helps prepare learners for a professional role as a data architect. The program covers database design, data modeling, data warehouses, big data architectures and data governance. It consists of four "courses", each with a final project. The projects I created are linked below.

## Course 1: Data Architecture Foundations

This course covered the foundations of data architecture, including relational data design, conceptual, logical and physical entity relationship diagrams, and the creation of physical database schemas using Data Definition Language.

The final course project involved the design and creation of a [human resouce database](/1%20-%20Data%20Architecture%20Foundations).

## Course 2: Designing Data Systems

The second course covered the major components used in architecting enterprise data systems. This included the design of a staging area, operational data store, and a data warehouse. 

The final project involved ingesting data into a staging database, moving the data to the operational data store where data is transformed, and finally creating and accessing the [data warehouse](/2%20-%20Designing%20Data%20Systems). 

## Course 3: Big Data Systems

This course examined the characteristics of Big Data, its business value, and how it is used by enterprises today. It covered the most popular storage and processing frameworks and ecosystem components, including NoSQL databases and modeling, as well as data lakes.

The final project was based on a real-world scenario that involved architecting and building an [end-to-end data lake system proposal](/3%20-%20Big%20Data%20Systems/).

## Course 4: Data Governance

The content of the final course covered the design of data governance solutions. This included: metadata and Metadata Management Systems, Enterprise Data Models, Enterprise Data Catalogs, data profiling, monitoring and remediation options for data quality issues, master data and golden records, and different types of Master Data Management architectures.

The [final project](/4%20-%20Governance/) entailed documenting an enterprise's data systems, setting up a data catalog, designing better data quality and master data management processes, and formalizing data governance roles.
